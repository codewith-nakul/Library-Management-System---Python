ðŸ“Œ Project: Library Management System

Description:
Developed a Library Management System using Python and Streamlit, implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The system allowed librarians and users to manage essential operations like adding, updating, deleting, and searching books, along with user registration and book borrowing/return tracking.

Key Features:

Designed an interactive Streamlit UI for user-friendly book and member management.

Implemented classes and inheritance for handling different entities (Books, Members, Admin).

Applied abstraction and polymorphism for flexible book search and record handling.

Integrated CSV/Database storage for persistent data handling.

Enabled features such as book availability check, fine calculation, and member activity history.

Tools & Technologies:

Python, Streamlit, Pandas, OOP Concepts

Impact:

Simplified library operations through automation.

Reduced manual effort by providing an intuitive digital interface.

Demonstrated strong programming skills by applying real-world OOP design principles.
